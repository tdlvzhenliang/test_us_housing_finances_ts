# test_us_housing_finances_ts

use a combination of python and R to extract & analyze housing financial data for US cities

metrics to extract (by city):
- median home price
- mortgage rate (fixed)
- LTV
- median rents

Then calculate:
- down payment
- monthly mortgage (assume 30-year mortgage)
- annual rental income yield

Then plot a time series of this data, say monthly (historical only)
- all 7 variables mentioned above

Do this for a set of major US cities:
- say New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Seattle

Create a dashboard to select by city or by metric


NOTE: this is inspired by my own personal aspirations to purchase a home in the United States, 
and at the same time, using a combination of data science, programming and real estate finance
to conduct corresponding research and analysis.
